### Project Purpose

**Primary Purpose:**  
Free and open source tool for packaging desktop applications across multiple platforms

**Target Users:**
- Web developers packaging Electron applications
- Educational software creators
- Small development teams
- Open source projects
- Individual developers and students

**Educational/Non-Profit Nature:**  
Yes - The tool is specifically designed to help developers, educators, and open source projects package applications without requiring expensive commercial tools or deep platform-specific knowledge. It democratizes multi-platform application deployment.

**Commercial Use:**  
The tool itself is free and open source. Users may use it to package both commercial and non-commercial applications. The tool does not generate revenue.

---

### Code Signing Requirements

**Platforms Requiring Signing:**
- Windows (EXE and NSIS installers)
- macOS (DMG and app bundles) - optional but recommended

**Why Code Signing is Needed:**

1. **Windows SmartScreen Protection:**
   - Without code signing, Windows displays security warnings
   - Users see "Unknown publisher" warnings
   - Reduces trust and adoption
   - Legitimate educational software should not trigger security warnings

2. **User Trust:**
   - Educational software needs to be trusted by default
   - Students and teachers should not encounter security barriers
   - Professional appearance for open source tools

3. **Distribution:**
   - Easier distribution through educational institutions
   - Reduced support burden from security warnings
   - Better user experience

**Current Situation:**
- Tool packages applications successfully
- Output applications are unsigned
- Users encounter Windows SmartScreen warnings
- This creates unnecessary friction for legitimate educational use

**Expected Usage:**
- Estimated 10-50 signings per month
- Primarily for tool releases and example applications
- Educational and demonstration purposes
