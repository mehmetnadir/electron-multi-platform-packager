## Email Body

```
Dear SignPath Foundation Team,

I am writing to apply for a free SignPath.io subscription for our open source project, "Electron Multi-Platform Packager."

Project Overview:
- Name: Electron Multi-Platform Packager
- URL: https://github.com/mehmetnadir/electron-multi-platform-packager
- License: MIT (OSI-approved)
- Status: Active development, v1.0.0 released October 2025

Project Purpose:
Our project is a free, open-source desktop application that helps developers, students, and educators package web applications into native executables for multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, PWA). It's designed specifically to make multi-platform deployment accessible without requiring expensive commercial tools or deep platform-specific expertise.

Key Features:
- Automates 97% of packaging time (5 minutes vs 6+ hours manually)
- Automatic icon generation (25+ formats from one PNG)
- Zero configuration required
- Supports 5 platforms from a single interface
- Completely free and open source

Why We Need Code Signing:
We are requesting code signing certificates to:

1. Remove Windows SmartScreen warnings for legitimate educational software
2. Provide a professional, trusted experience for students and educators
3. Reduce barriers to adoption for open source educational tools
4. Enable wider distribution through educational institutions

Our tool packages applications that are used in educational settings. Without code signing, these legitimate educational applications trigger security warnings, creating unnecessary friction for students and teachers.

Educational Impact:
The project serves the educational and open source community by:
- Making professional packaging tools accessible to students
- Helping educators create and distribute educational software
- Supporting small open source projects with limited resources
- Democratizing multi-platform application deployment

Compliance:
We have reviewed and agree to comply with the SignPath Foundation Code of Conduct. Our project:
- Is genuinely open source (MIT License)
- Serves educational and development purposes
- Will use code signing exclusively for our open source releases
- Does not generate revenue or have commercial aspects
- Maintains transparent development on GitHub

Expected Usage:
- Estimated 10-50 signings per month
- Primarily for tool releases and example applications
- Educational and demonstration purposes
- All releases will be publicly available on GitHub

Project Maturity:
- v1.0.0 released with comprehensive documentation
- Active development and maintenance
- Open to community contributions
- Professional development practices
- Clear roadmap for future development

Attached is the completed OSS Request Form (OSSRequestForm-v4.xlsx) with detailed project information.

We believe this project aligns perfectly with SignPath Foundation's mission to support the open source community and make code signing accessible to educational projects.

Thank you for considering our application. We would be honored to join the SignPath Foundation's community of open source projects.

Best regards,

Mehmet Nadir
